## 1. Introduction

This is the second project created for Bootcamp Full Stack with JavaScript.

The project consists of creating a CRUD application prototype using the DOM object structure, data persistence and storage in window.localStorage.

## 2. Characteristics
It is a website that uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, including Flexbox techniques, Responsive Web Design, Document Object Model (DOM), and data persistence by saving to localStorage. The IDE is Visual Studio Code.

Other tools such as bootstrap are not used, in this way everything related to responsive is generated manually considering the view from a computer screen, tablet and smartphone.

## 3. WebSite
This website is based on a real case from the place where I currently work, in an educational institution that is outside the city of Antofagasta.
For those of us who live in the city, we have approach buses since there is no public transport for that sector. In the case of workers who have their children who study in the same place, they can use the same bus.

    It is the home page, it depends on the administration of the personal and routes pages.
    A worker can be assigned to a specific route, in case the person needs to travel with children, they can indicate it here.
    
 - **b. Rutas**
    
    On this page you can manage the routes with a maximum of 10 stops (only one is mandatory), in addition to indicating the number of seats.
    
- **c. Personal**

    On this page you can manage the staff who need transportation.
